## 1. SCOPE

This page describes the materials used in AURICLE jewellery and explains how UK hallmarking applies. It covers products sold on **auricle.co.uk**, **auriclejewelry.com**, and items supplied through our trade channels.

---

## 2. MATERIALS

### 2.1 14K GOLD (AU 585)

• Nominal fineness is **585 parts per thousand**.  
• Offered in yellow, rose or white gold finishes.  
• White gold may have a rhodium finish. Normal surface wear may occur over time, depending on usage and care.

### 2.2 TITANIUM (IMPLANT-CONTACT PARTS)

• Components that pass through the skin, such as labret posts or bars, are specified and tested for conformity with **ASTM F136** (Ti-6Al-4V ELI surgical implant alloy) or the equivalent **ISO 5832-3** standard when this is stated on the product page.  
• ASTM F136 and ISO 5832-3 are material specifications that define chemical composition and mechanical requirements. They are not material names.  
• Titanium is not classed as a precious metal under UK hallmarking law. See section 4.

### 2.3 PVD COATINGS (APPLIED TO TITANIUM)

• Some titanium components use **PVD coating** to produce colour, such as a gold tone.  
• PVD is durable but not permanent. Wear levels vary depending on abrasion, chemicals, skin pH and handling.

### 2.4 NICKEL AND ALLERGIES

• Items intended for prolonged skin contact are designed to comply with **EN 1811** nickel release limits.  
• Sensitivities vary from person to person. No material can be considered universally suitable for every wearer.

### 2.5 TESTING AND VERIFICATION (TITANIUM)

• AURICLE tests labret posts and backs that pass through the skin against the relevant ASTM F136 criteria and references ISO 5832-3 where applicable.  
• Other titanium jewellery is selected for periodic random testing.  
• If you need material confirmation before purchase, email **info@auricle.co.uk**.

For guidance on care and handling, follow the information on the product page or contact us before ordering.

## 3. MIXED MATERIAL PRODUCTS

Some pieces combine precious metal fronts with non-precious components such as titanium backs.  
Descriptions on the product page identify which parts are gold and which are not.  
Where mixed materials are used, hallmarking applies only to the precious metal portion. See section 4.

---

## 4. UK HALLMARKING (SUMMARY)

### 4.1 WHEN HALLMARKING APPLIES

Under UK hallmarking law, articles described as precious metal must be hallmarked by a UK Assay Office when they exceed the statutory weight limits. Examples:

• Gold items above **1.0 g** must be hallmarked.  
• Items at or below the legal threshold are exempt.

### 4.2 WHAT A UK HALLMARK INCLUDES

A UK hallmark normally includes:

• The sponsor’s mark (registered responsibility mark)  
• The fineness mark, such as **585** for 14K gold  
• The Assay Office mark (London, Birmingham, Sheffield or Edinburgh)

A date letter may be included at the discretion of the Assay Office.

### 4.3 SMALL PARTS AND LASER APPLICATION

Because body jewellery components are small, a hallmark may be:

• Applied with a laser on a suitable surface, or  
• Omitted if the item is below the legal weight threshold or is technically unsuitable for marking

Where only part of the item is precious metal, the hallmark appears on that precise part when feasible.

### 4.4 TITANIUM AND OTHER NON PRECIOUS METALS

Titanium is not classed as a precious metal under UK law and is not hallmarked.  
Where a product contains both precious and non precious parts, any hallmark relates only to the precious metal portion.
