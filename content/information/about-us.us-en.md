## Who we are

AURICLE is a UK-based body piercing jewelry brand supplying professional piercing studios and jewelry retailers across the UK and EU.

After decades of studio and industry experience, we set out to create a high-quality jewelry brand that studios would be proud to stock and clients would feel confident wearing every day.

For many years, some of the most respected and recognized high-quality body piercing jewelry has come from the United States. We created AURICLE to offer a UK-based option at that same level, not as a replacement, but as an alternative for studios closer to home.

As a UK company, we operate under UK and EU law. Our products are developed for civilian, medical-adjacent jewelry use and are governed by UK consumer and product safety legislation, which defines how materials, testing, and compliance are handled in this market.

## Why we do it

In piercing, claims alone don’t mean much. Quality needs to be provable.

Too often, decisions are made on reputation or assumption rather than evidence. We believe studios should be able to understand exactly what they are fitting and why it meets the standards required for professional use.

That belief is what drives how we build AURICLE and how we verify the jewelry we supply.

## How we do it

We use independent, third-party testing throughout the jewelry manufacturing process. From verified ingot certification at the mill through to testing of finished jewelry, our focus is on confirming what the material actually is at every stage, not just what it started as.

All titanium components are produced to ASTM F-136 specification. Gold pieces are cast as solid 14k and formulated for biocompatibility. Materials are selected specifically for professional piercing, including initial piercings where appropriate.

Because material composition and surface condition can change during manufacture and finishing, we don’t rely solely on raw material certification. Verification continues through to the finished product.

### Mill certification and third-party verification

Material control begins at the ingot stage.

We use third-party verified certification from the producing mill to confirm raw material composition before manufacturing begins. This establishes a clear starting point and ensures the material entering production meets the required specification.

Mill certification matters, but on its own it is not the full picture.

### Finished product testing

Once jewelry has been manufactured and finished, it is independently tested against [ASTM F-136](/quality-assurance/astm-f136) to confirm compliance at completed-product stage.

This approach allows us to verify the jewelry as it reaches the customer, not just where it started from. It reflects the reality that manufacturing and finishing processes can affect material condition, surface quality, and performance.

Finished-product testing is central to how we demonstrate material compliance.

### Surface roughness testing (mirror polish)

“Mirror polish” is a term that is often used loosely. For us, it refers to a measurable surface finish rather than a visual description.

Surface finish matters in professional piercing because it directly affects how jewelry behaves in real use. A smoother surface reduces friction, limits debris retention, and contributes to a more predictable wear experience.

For that reason, finished titanium components are independently tested for surface roughness to medical implant benchmarks. [Learn more about our mirror polish testing](/quality-assurance/mirror-finish). This allows us to confirm that polishing achieves a consistently low-roughness finish appropriate for medical-adjacent use.

The result is a surface finish that is measured, repeatable, and verifiable, not assumed.

## UK & EU frameworks

We operate within the UK and EU market and work within the regulatory environment that applies here.

Our products are manufactured for civilian, medical-adjacent jewelry use within the UK and EU and are governed by UK consumer and product safety standards. These standards define how materials, testing, and compliance are handled for professional piercing in this market.

Our focus is on demonstrable material compliance and finished-product verification, providing studios with confidence in what they are fitting. We build our supply chain deliberately and continue refining our processes as guidance and best practice evolve within the UK industry.

## DFARS and regulatory context

DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) is a United States defense procurement framework used within military and defense supply chains.

In the UK and EU, professional body jewelry operates under a different regulatory environment. We produce civilian, medical-adjacent jewelry for professional piercing within the UK and EU market and operate under UK consumer and product safety standards appropriate to this use.

For that reason, DFARS does not form part of our manufacturing or verification framework. Instead, material quality is demonstrated through independent testing of finished jewelry against ASTM F-136, ensuring the jewelry supplied to studios meets standards relevant to professional piercing. [Read more about DFARS and our regulatory context](/quality-assurance/dfars).

This reflects the regulatory context in which we operate and the expectations of UK and EU studios.

## And it looks good too

We can talk about standards, testing, and verification all day, but jewelry still has to make people smile when they see it.

Our pieces are dainty, beautiful, and designed to be worn. They’re made to sit nicely, feel comfortable, and become part of someone’s everyday look.

We’re confident your clients will love how it looks, how it feels, and how easy it is to live with. Because proving quality matters, but so does falling in love with the jewelry.
