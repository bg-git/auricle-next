<div className="information-page">

**Effective Date:** 9 August 2025

> **NON-NEGOTIABLE POLICY:** Authorisation to resell AURICLE products and to use our brand assets requires compliance with this policy, including our **Minimum Advertised Price (MAP)** rules. If you do not agree, do not resell AURICLE products. See also [TERMS OF SALE](/information/terms-of-sale), [TERMS OF SERVICE](/information/terms-of-service) and [DESIGNS & IP](/information/design-copyright-ip-notice).

---

## 1. PURPOSE & SUMMARY

- We publish a **Recommended Retail Price (RRP)** on product pages; unless otherwise stated in writing, **RRP = MAP** for that item.  
- **MAP controls *publicly advertised* prices only.** You remain **free to set your actual selling price** at any level you choose.  
- This policy is a **unilateral condition of authorisation and supply**. It is **not** an agreement to fix resale prices.

---

## 2. WHO IS COVERED

All customers who **resell** AURICLE-branded products (online or offline), including distributors and retailers that use AURICLE images, copy or trademarks. Authorisation may be withdrawn for non-compliance.

---

## 3. WHAT COUNTS AS “PUBLICLY ADVERTISED” PRICE

Any price visible **without a specific one-to-one quote**, including:

- Website product/listing pages visible without login  
- Printed catalogues, flyers, in-store signage visible to the public  
- Social posts, ads (including Google Shopping/Meta), price-comparison feeds  
- Marketplace listings (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Etsy)  
- Public coupon/voucher codes shown on site or in mass marketing

**Not covered (examples):** private quotes to a single customer; negotiated trade lists sent 1:1 by email; prices visible **only after** logging into a restricted trade portal you control.

> If in doubt whether something is “publicly advertised,” treat it as **public**.

---

## 4. MAP RULE

- Do **not** publicly advertise any AURICLE item **below the RRP/MAP** shown on our product page (or a different MAP we communicate in writing).  
- “Below” includes effective prices after **automatic discounts**, **stackable public vouchers**, or **bundles** that drive the per-unit public price below MAP.  
- You may use **“POA / Call for price”** or omit public pricing.  
- Temporary promotions **at or above** MAP are allowed.

---

## 5. SALE PRICE FREEDOM (IMPORTANT)

This policy concerns **advertised** price only. **Actual transactional sale prices are entirely your decision.** We do not seek or accept any agreement about your **final resale price**.

---

## 6. ONLINE MARKETPLACES & ADVERTISING

- Listing AURICLE products on **third-party marketplaces** may require **our prior written approval**.  
- If approved, marketplace and shopping-feed pricing must **meet or exceed MAP**.  
- Do not bid on AURICLE trademarks (or close misspellings) in search ads without written permission.

---

## 7. BRAND ASSETS & CONTENT

Use of AURICLE images, copy and logos is subject to [DESIGNS & IP](/information/design-copyright-ip-notice). We may **withdraw the image/content licence** and request takedown for MAP breaches or brand misuse.

---

## 8. MONITORING & ENFORCEMENT

We may monitor public channels and comparison sites. If we identify a breach:

1) **Notice:** We’ll request correction within a specified timeframe.  
2) **Asset suspension:** We may withdraw content/image licences and remove you from the “authorised” list.  
3) **Supply actions:** We may suspend discounts, cancel pending orders, or **suspend/terminate** your account for repeated or serious breaches.

Our decisions under this policy are final.

---

## 9. COMPETITION LAW

Nothing in this policy requires you to sell at any particular price. It governs **public advertising** only and is intended to be applied in a lawful, proportionate manner. You should take your own legal advice where needed.
