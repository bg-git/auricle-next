<div className="information-page">

AURICLE is a trade-only body piercing jewellery brand for professional piercers and jewellery retailers. Built on 20 years of studio experience, the focus is premium materials, precise manufacturing, and clear, reliable pricing for trade accounts.

Quality without the markup: 14k solid gold and ASTM F-136 titanium, produced to tight tolerances and consistent fit. Pricing is benchmarked against other premium sholesalers to stay among the lowest while standards remain at the top end, so quality becomes the default in every studio, not an upsell.

## What we make

AURICLE designs and produces threadless ends, labrets, and rings in 14k solid gold and ASTM F-136 titanium. Every piece is built for daily studio use: tight tolerances, smooth finishes, secure stone settings, and a clean, consistent fit. Proportions are refined and intentionally small, especially ends, so jewellery wears comfortably day-to-day.

## Why threadless first

We prioritise threadless for speed, comfort, and reliability. Threads are supported where appropriate, but our hierarchy is clear:

- **Threadless (pin fit)** — No threads, secure friction fit, fast to install, kind to tissue, easy to downsize, highest manufacturing precision.
- **Internal thread** — Industry standard, more costly to produce than external, kinder to tissue than external thread, reliable fit, but fine threads can be delicate.
- **External thread** — Cheaper to produce and mechanically robust, but the exposed threads can abrade tissue during insertion and removal.

The result: small, precise jewellery that handles repeat wear use without fuss.

## How it’s made

Production runs to a tight spec. Dimensions are checked against drawings, settings are inspected for stone security, and edges are finished for a low snag surface. Titanium is implant-grade; gold is 14k and nickel safe by design. Each batch is test fitted across standard threadless systems to confirm consistent pin engagement and hold.

## What we verify

- **Material control:** Labret posts are produced to ASTM F-136 specification (certificate available on request). Gold alloys are formulated for biocompatibility and cast as 14k solid, no plating on load-bearing parts.
- **Dimensional accuracy:** Critical features (post diameter, pin length, seat depth) are measured to tight tolerances for repeatable fit.
- **Setting security:** Stone seats and prongs are checked under magnification for retention and symmetry.
- **Finish quality:** Contact surfaces are polished and edges are deburred/chamfered to minimise tissue abrasion during insertion and wear.
- **System fit:** Threadless pins are gauged for consistent interference fit with common backings; batches are spot checked across multiple components.

## Why the labret matters

The labret is the part that passes through tissue, so it gets the highest scrutiny: ASTM F-136 spec, burr-free edges, smooth mirror-polished shaft, and a flat, comfortable backing.

## How we release

AURICLE ships in small, frequent drops. The catalogue stays focused; new variants land steadily as retailers request them. Core sellers are kept in rotation. Limited runs test new ideas without bloating inventory.

## Operating rules

- **Lean catalogue:** only pieces that earn their space.
- **Variant by request:** add sizes/finishes where studios need them.
- **Core lines on repeat:** predictable restock for day-to-day use.
- **Limited runs:** fast feedback, no dead stock.

Every item is designed to be a bestseller, a studio staple that moves, not a showcase piece that gathers dust.

## Access and pricing

## What we don’t do

**Bottom line:** AURICLE support is built to protect your margin, reduce admin, and keep product moving. No noise—just tools that help you sell.

## What AURICLE stands for

AURICLE exists to make quality the default. Premium materials, precise manufacturing, and honest pricing, so studios can stock confidently and clients can wear every day without compromise. We are trade only for a reason: the focus is retailer (Studio or store) outcomes, not theatre.

We stand for function over ornament and precision over noise, tight tolerances, clean finishes, secure settings, and a catalogue that earns its space. No gimmicks rolled into unit cost, no admin-heavy programmes, no bloated inventories. We keep the line lean, the data complete, and the re-orders predictable, because a studio’s time, cash flow, and reputation matter.

We want every partner to be proud to stock AURICLE: a brand that protects margin, ships what it promises, and supports with practical tools instead of marketing stunts. And we want every client to be proud to wear AURICLE: small, refined pieces—14k gold and ASTM F-136 standard titanium, priced fairly, built accurately, and made for every day life.

**In short:** extreme quality, fair price, quiet design, and zero fluff. That’s what we want, and that’s what we stand for.
