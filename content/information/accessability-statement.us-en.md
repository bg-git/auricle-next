<div className="information-page">

**Effective Date:** 9 August 2025

This statement applies to all AURICLE websites and to the checkout experience.

> We aim to make our services usable by as many people as possible. If you encounter any accessibility barriers, please contact **info@auricle.co.uk**. Our response target is **5 business days**.

## 1. SCOPE

This statement covers:

- **auricle.co.uk**
- **auriclejewelry.com**
- **Shopify Checkout** (hosted on a separate Shopify domain)
- Third-party services used within the purchase flow, including **DHL**, **Royal Mail**, and our **ChatGPT-based live chat**

Use of our websites is governed by the [TERMS OF SERVICE](/information/terms-of-service).  
For information on personal data and cookies, see the [PRIVACY POLICY](/information/privacy-policy) and [COOKIE POLICY](/information/cookie-policy).

---

## 2. STANDARD WE AIM TO MEET

Our goal is to meet **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** across all core user journeys: browsing, account management, cart, and checkout.  
Some third-party components may not fully meet these standards. See §6 for more detail.

WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) define how to make digital content more accessible for users with disabilities. Level AA is the commonly adopted benchmark.

---

## 3. WHAT WE’VE TESTED

We regularly test using the following methods:

- **Keyboard-only navigation**
- **Automated audits** using Lighthouse
- **Manual checks** on Windows, iOS, and Android devices

We continue to refine headings, focus order, alternative text, and form labels as part of our ongoing development work.

---

## 4. SUPPORTED ENVIRONMENTS

The websites are built on **Next.js** and hosted on **Vercel**. We support **modern browsers** that receive security updates.  
Older or unsupported browsers may not display the site or checkout correctly.

---

## 5. KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- **Color and imagery:** Display characteristics can vary by device, screen type, and user settings. Jewelry colors and finishes may appear different in person compared with on-screen images.
- **Third-party components:** Some elements provided by Shopify Checkout, DHL, Royal Mail, and the ChatGPT live chat may not meet WCAG 2.2 AA in full. We pass accessibility issues to the relevant vendors when possible.

If you experience an issue that is not listed here, please contact us at **info@auricle.co.uk**.

---

## 6. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

Parts of the user experience rely on external providers:

- **Shopify Checkout** for payments and order processing
- **DHL** and **Royal Mail** for rate calculation, label creation, and tracking links
- **Live chat** powered by the **ChatGPT API**

Although we do not control their codebases, we monitor changes and send feedback where relevant.

---

## 7. NON-HTML CONTENT

We do not currently provide general PDF downloads.  
**Invoice PDFs** may be issued during the order process through Shopify. These documents may not yet meet all accessibility criteria.

---

## 8. COOKIES

Cookies are required for essential functions such as authentication, cart management, and checkout.  
We do not offer per-category cookie preferences. You may accept the required cookies and continue using the website, or choose not to use the website.  
For more detail, see the [COOKIE POLICY](/information/cookie-policy).
