<div className="information-page">

**Effective Date:** 9 August 2025

This statement applies to the AURICLE websites and checkout experience.

> We aim to make our services usable by as many people as possible. If you experience any accessibility barriers, contact **info@auricle.co.uk** — we aim to respond within **5 business days**.

---

## 1. SCOPE

This statement covers:

- **auricle.co.uk**
- **auriclejewelry.com**
- **Shopify Checkout** (hosted on a separate Shopify domain)
- Third-party integrations used within our purchase flow, including **DHL** and **Royal Mail** (for shipping rate/label/tracking), and our **live chat** powered by the **ChatGPT API**

Website use is governed by our [TERMS OF SERVICE](/terms-of-service). For personal data and cookies, see our [PRIVACY POLICY](/privacy-policy) and [COOKIE POLICY](/cookie-policy).

---

## 2. STANDARD WE AIM TO MEET

We **aim to meet** the **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** guidelines across core user journeys (browsing, account, cart, checkout). Some third-party components may not fully meet these guidelines; see §6.

> WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) define how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. “Level AA” is the commonly adopted benchmark.

---

## 3. WHAT WE’VE TESTED

- **Keyboard-only navigation** (no mouse)
- **Automated audits** using Lighthouse
- **Manual checks** on **Windows**, **iOS**, and **Android** devices

We continue to iterate on headings, focus order, alt text, and form labels as part of ongoing development.

---

## 4. SUPPORTED ENVIRONMENTS

The sites are built with **Next.js** and deployed on **Vercel**. We support **modern browsers** that receive security updates. Older or unsupported browsers may not function correctly.

---

## 5. KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- **Colour & imagery:** Display characteristics vary by device and screen type. Jewellery colours and finishes may appear different in real life compared with on-screen images.  
- **Third-party components:** Some elements provided by Shopify (checkout), DHL, Royal Mail, and the ChatGPT-powered live chat may not fully align with WCAG 2.2 AA. We raise issues with vendors where feasible.

If you encounter an issue not listed here, please tell us at **info@auricle.co.uk**.

---

## 6. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

We rely on third parties for some functionality:
- **Shopify Checkout** (payments, order processing)
- **DHL** and **Royal Mail** (rates, label generation, tracking links)
- **Live chat via ChatGPT API**

While we do not control their code, we monitor changes and pass on accessibility feedback.

---

## 7. NON-HTML CONTENT

We currently do **not** offer general PDF downloads. **Invoice PDFs** may be issued as part of your order process via Shopify; these may not yet meet all accessibility criteria.

---

## 8. COOKIES

Cookies are required for core functionality (authentication, cart, checkout). We do **not** provide per-category cookie settings. You may accept cookies to use the website, or decline by not using the website. See the [COOKIE POLICY](/cookie-policy).

---

## 9. FEEDBACK & CONTACT

If you need assistance or wish to report an accessibility problem:
- Email: **info@auricle.co.uk**  
- Response target: **within 5 business days**

---

## 10. ENFORCEMENT & REVIEW

We review this statement **annually** and whenever we make significant changes to the websites or checkout.
