## 2. APPLICABILITY UNDER LAW

## 3. OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAIN

AURICLE operates a B2B wholesale jewellery business serving professional piercing studios and jewellers.  
Our supply chain covers material sourcing, manufacturing, finishing, packaging, logistics (including **Royal Mail** and **DHL**) and professional services.

---

## 4. POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS

Our minimum expectations include:

• Zero tolerance of forced labour, child labour, human trafficking, debt bondage or unsafe working conditions  
• Compliance with applicable labour, health and safety and immigration laws  
• Transparency on production sites, subcontracting arrangements and key manufacturing steps  
• A right for AURICLE to request reasonable information relating to labour practices where risk is present  
• Cooperation with investigations and corrective actions when required

These standards form part of supplier onboarding and ongoing supplier management.

---

## 5. DUE DILIGENCE

We apply proportionate checks during onboarding and at intervals thereafter, including:

• Supplier questionnaires covering labour practices, workforce conditions and site locations  
• Requests for verification, such as summaries of independent audits, certifications or policy commitments  
• Contract terms requiring compliance with anti slavery laws and AURICLE standards  
• Additional review where geography, sector or product category presents elevated risk

---

## 6. RISK ASSESSMENT

We consider risk using several factors:

• Geography, using recognised country risk indices and industry research  
• Process risk linked to outsourced manufacturing and subcontracting  
• Indicators such as unusual lead times, pricing that cannot support legal wages or limits on worker freedom of movement

Where higher risk is identified, we increase our level of due diligence and may require corrective measures.

---

## 7. MONITORING, NON COMPLIANCE AND REMEDIATION

• We investigate credible concerns in good faith and request evidence where needed  
• Where issues are identified, we work with the supplier to agree a Corrective Action Plan with clear timelines  
• For serious or unresolved breaches, we may suspend orders or end the supplier relationship  
• We maintain appropriate records of investigations and outcomes

---

## 8. TRAINING AND AWARENESS

Relevant staff in buying, operations and leadership receive periodic guidance on:

• Identifying warning signs of modern slavery and trafficking  
• Understanding AURICLE reporting channels and escalation steps  
• How supplier engagement and contract controls help reduce risk

---

## 9. REPORTING CONCERNS (WHISTLEBLOWING)

Anyone may report concerns to **info@auricle.co.uk**.  
We treat reports sensitively, share information on a need to know basis and do not tolerate retaliation for good faith reporting.

---

## 10. METRICS WE TRACK

We monitor:

• Number of supplier risk reviews completed  
• Corrective Action Plans issued and resolved  
• Issues escalated to suspension or termination  
• Training completion by relevant staff
