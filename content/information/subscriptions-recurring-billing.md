<div className="information-page">

**Effective Date:** 9 August 2025

> **NON-NEGOTIABLE TERMS:** Subscribing authorises recurring charges as described below. We do not offer bespoke variations. If you do not agree, do not subscribe. See also the [TERMS OF SALE](/terms-of-sale), [TERMS OF SERVICE](/terms-of-service), [PRIVACY POLICY](/privacy-policy), and [COOKIE POLICY](/cookie-policy).

---

## 1. SCOPE

These terms apply to AURICLE subscription-based services offered to **B2B customers** via our websites or by direct invoice. Website use is governed by the [TERMS OF SERVICE](/terms-of-service).

---

## 2. ELIGIBILITY

Subscriptions are available to **legitimate businesses** (e.g., studios, jewellers, distributors) with approved accounts. We may refuse, suspend, or cancel a subscription at our discretion (e.g., risk, misuse, non-payment).

---

## 3. BILLING & RENEWAL

- Subscriptions are **recurring** and billed **on the first day of each calendar month** according to your selected plan.  
- By providing a payment method, you **authorise** AURICLE to charge the recurring fees automatically until you cancel.  
- Fees are shown **before** you confirm enrollment and may be subject to taxes (see the [TAX / VAT POLICY](/tax-policy)).

> Cookies are required for account, basket, and checkout features. We do **not** offer per-category cookie settings. Accept cookies to use the Website; otherwise, do not use the Website. See the [COOKIE POLICY](/cookie-policy).

---

## 4. PAYMENT METHODS

- We accept **debit/credit cards**.  
- We **do not** accept Amazon Pay, PayPal, WeChat Pay, Alipay, Klarna, or other third-party wallets.  
- You are responsible for keeping payment information **accurate and up to date**.

---

## 5. CANCELLATION

- You may cancel at any time via your account or by emailing **info@auricle.co.uk** from your registered address.  
- Cancellation takes effect at the **end of the current billing period**.  
- Unless required by law, **no refunds** or credits are given for **partial months** or unused time.

---

## 6. FAILED PAYMENTS & SUSPENSION

- If a payment fails, we may retry your card and contact you for an updated method.  
- If charges remain unpaid after reasonable attempts, we may **suspend** or **cancel** the subscription and related benefits until payment is received.

---

## 7. CHANGES TO PLANS & PRICING

- We may change plan features or pricing. **Material changes** will be notified in advance (for example, by email or on-site notice).  
- If you do not agree with the change, you may **cancel** before the next billing date; continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

## 8. SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS

Any benefits tied to a subscription (e.g., discounts, eligibility, gated access, shipping options) are **plan-dependent** and may be modified, replaced, or withdrawn on notice. Benefits have **no cash value** and are **non-transferable**.

## 9. TAXES

Charges may be subject to **VAT** or other taxes depending on your location and status. See the [TAX / VAT POLICY](/tax-policy). You are responsible for providing accurate tax identifiers where required.

---

## 10. COMMUNICATIONS

We may send subscription-related **notices, invoices, and service updates** by email or via the website. You may opt out of marketing emails, but you will still receive **service-critical** communications.

---

## 11. MISUSE & TERMINATION

We may suspend or terminate a subscription for breach (e.g., abuse, fraud, resale of benefits, policy violations). Termination for breach does not create any obligation to refund amounts already paid.

---

## 12. GOVERNING LAW & JURISDICTION

These terms (and any non-contractual disputes) are governed by the laws of **England and Wales**. The courts of **England and Wales** have exclusive jurisdiction.
