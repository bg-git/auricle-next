**Effective Date:** 9 August 2025

> **NON-NEGOTIABLE POLICY:** VAT treatment, export rules, and invoicing are applied as described in this TAX / VAT POLICY. If you do not agree, do not place an order. See also the [TERMS OF SALE](/terms-of-sale) and [SHIPPING & DELIVERY POLICY](/shipping-policy).

---

## 1. SCOPE

This policy applies to all B2B purchases from AURICLE via our website or direct invoice. Website use is governed by the [TERMS OF SERVICE](/terms-of-service).

---

## 2. UK VAT (DOMESTIC SUPPLIES)

- For deliveries **within the United Kingdom**, prices are shown in **GBP** and are **subject to UK VAT at 20%** unless a lawful zero-rating applies.  
- VAT is shown as a **separate line** at checkout and on your invoice.  
- Northern Ireland is treated as **UK VAT area** for deliveries from us; UK VAT rules apply.

> Note: Domestic reverse charge **does not** apply to our supplies of goods.

---

## 3. EXPORTS OUTSIDE THE UK (EU & REST OF WORLD)

- For deliveries **outside the UK**, UK VAT will be **deducted at checkout** when a valid non-UK delivery address is provided.  
- International orders are shipped on **DAP/DDU (Delivered At Place / formerly DDU)** terms (see §4).  
- The **importer of record** (you) is responsible for all import VAT and duties payable in the destination country.

---

## 4. DUTIES, IMPORT VAT & BROKERAGE (DAP/DDU)

- Under **DAP/DDU**, **import VAT, customs duties, brokerage/clearance fees, and local taxes are payable by you** to the carrier or your local authority.  
- If you refuse or fail to pay import charges, the shipment may be **returned or destroyed** by the carrier. Any return, storage, re-shipping, or destruction fees are **your responsibility**.

See the [SHIPPING & DELIVERY POLICY](/shipping-policy) for carrier details.

---

## 5. PRICING, CURRENCY & DISPLAY

- Prices are shown in **GBP**. Any USD/EUR figures displayed are **approximate** and for guidance only. Your card provider sets the exchange rate at the time of charge.  
- All prices **exclude** shipping; delivery charges are shown at checkout prior to confirmation.

---

## 6. VAT INVOICES & DOCUMENTATION

- A **VAT invoice** is issued for UK-VATable supplies.  
- For exports, we issue a **commercial invoice** and customs documentation declaring the goods’ **true value** and HS codes. We **do not undervalue** or mark as “gift.”  
- On authorised returns/adjustments, we issue **credit notes** referencing the original invoice.

---

## 7. TAX IDENTIFIERS (VAT / EORI)

- We may request your **VAT number** and/or **EORI** (where applicable) to assist with compliant invoicing and customs clearance.  
- Providing incorrect or missing identifiers can cause delays and additional costs, which are **your responsibility**.

---

## 8. FREIGHT FORWARDERS & INDIRECT EXPORTS

- If you arrange export via a **UK freight forwarder** or collect goods in the UK, zero-rating may depend on receiving **acceptable proof of export within required timeframes**.  
- Where sufficient evidence is not provided, we may have to **charge UK VAT** or subsequently **re-invoice**.

---

## 9. ERRORS, CORRECTIONS & COMPLIANCE

- If pricing or tax presentation errors occur due to human/system error, we may **correct or cancel** the affected order and **refund** any amounts paid.  
- We reserve the right to request reasonable information needed to satisfy VAT/export compliance and to **delay or cancel** shipments until received.

---

## 10. RECORD KEEPING & RETENTION

We retain transactional records (including invoices and supporting export evidence) for statutory periods to meet **tax and auditing** obligations.

---

## 11. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes take effect when posted on this page.
