**Effective Date:** 9 August 2025

> **NON-NEGOTIABLE POLICY:** Shipping is provided only on the terms set out in this SHIPPING & DELIVERY POLICY. If you do not agree, do not place an order. See also the [TERMS OF SALE](/terms-of-sale).

---

## 1. SCOPE

This policy applies to all orders placed with AURICLE via our website or by direct invoice. Website use is governed by the [TERMS OF SERVICE](/terms-of-service).

---

## 2. CARRIERS AND SERVICE OPTIONS

- **United Kingdom:** You may select **Royal Mail** or **DHL** at checkout (where offered).  
- **International (outside UK):** Orders are shipped via **DHL**.

Available services shown at checkout may vary by destination, order value, contents, and security checks.

---

## 3. CHARGES, ESTIMATES, AND TIMING

- **Shipping charges** are displayed at checkout before you confirm your order.  
- **Delivery estimates** are indicative and not guaranteed; transit times can be affected by carrier performance, customs controls, local delivery conditions, and other external factors.  
- Estimates are calculated **from dispatch**, not from the time you place your order.

---

## 4. DISPATCH & HANDLING

- Orders are prepared and dispatched on **business days** (excluding UK public holidays).  
- Verification steps (e.g., payment/anti-fraud, address confirmation) may affect dispatch timing.  
- We may consolidate multiple items into a single shipment or split into partial shipments (see [TERMS OF SALE](/terms-of-sale)).

---

## 5. ADDRESSES, SIGNATURE & ACCESS

- We ship only to **countries shown at checkout**.  
- **No PO Boxes.**  
- A **signature** may be required on delivery. Carriers may request proof of identity where appropriate.  
- You are responsible for providing a **complete and accurate address** and for ensuring someone is available to receive the goods. Delivery problems arising from incomplete/incorrect addresses are your responsibility.

---

## 6. TRACKING & DELIVERY ISSUES

- Tracking details (where available) are provided after dispatch.  
- If tracking shows “delivered” but you have not received the parcel, contact the **carrier first**, then notify us.  
- Report delivery issues **as soon as possible** so we can assist with carrier investigations.

---

## 7. INTERNATIONAL DUTIES, TAXES & CUSTOMS (DAP/DDU)

- International orders are shipped **DAP/DDU (Delivered At Place / formerly DDU)**.  
- **Import duties, taxes, brokerage, and customs charges** are **payable by you** to the carrier or your local authority.  
- Customs inspections can add **unpredictable delays** that are outside our control.  
- If you decline to pay import charges or cannot be contacted, the shipment may be returned or destroyed by the carrier. Any **return, storage, re-shipping, or destruction fees** are your responsibility.

For VAT treatment and invoices, see the [TAX POLICY](/tax-policy).

---

## 8. FAILED DELIVERY & RETURNS TO SENDER

- If delivery fails (e.g., no one available to sign, incorrect address, unpaid import charges) and the parcel is returned, we may charge **return and re-shipping fees**.  
- Re-delivery will be arranged once fees are settled and any address corrections are confirmed.

---

## 9. RISK & TITLE

- **Risk** in the products passes to you **on delivery** to the address provided (or to your nominated carrier).  
- **Title** passes when we receive **payment in full**, including all applicable delivery charges.  
- See the [TERMS OF SALE](/terms-of-sale) for full details.

---

## 10. DAMAGE, LOSS & SHORTAGES

- Inspect shipments **on receipt**.  
- Report any visible damage, loss, or shortages to the **carrier at delivery** (where possible) and notify us **promptly** at **info@auricle.co.uk**.  
- Keep all packaging and contents while a carrier investigation is in progress.

For faulty product handling, see the [RETURNS POLICY](/returns-policy).

---

## 11. RESTRICTIONS & COMPLIANCE

- Certain destinations, products, or materials may be **restricted** by carrier rules or local regulations.  
- We reserve the right to **cancel or amend** shipments that breach carrier or legal restrictions, with a refund for any undeliverable items.

## 12. FORCE MAJEURE

We are not liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond our reasonable control (including, without limitation, severe weather, strikes, carrier failures, customs actions, or governmental measures).
