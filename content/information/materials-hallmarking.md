## 1. SCOPE

This page describes the materials commonly used in AURICLE jewellery and how **UK hallmarking** applies. It covers products sold on **auricle.co.uk** and **auriclejewelry.com** and items supplied via our standard trade channels.

---

## 2. MATERIALS

### 2.1 14K GOLD (AU 585)
- Nominal fineness **585/1000**.  
- May be offered in **yellow**, **rose**, or **white** gold finishes.  
- **White gold:** surface appearance may involve rhodium finishing. Normal, gradual wear of surface finishes can occur with use and care conditions.

### 2.2 TITANIUM (IMPLANT-CONTACT PARTS)
- Where stated on the product page, components that **pass through the skin** (e.g., **labret posts/bars/backs**) are specified and tested for conformity with **ASTM F136** (Ti-6Al-4V ELI surgical implant alloy) or the equivalent **ISO 5832-3** standard.  
- Note: **ASTM F136** and **ISO 5832-3** are **material specifications/standards**, not material names. They define chemical composition and mechanical properties for Ti-6Al-4V ELI used in surgical implants.  
- Titanium is **not a precious metal** under UK hallmarking law (see §4).

### 2.3 PVD COATINGS (ON TITANIUM)
- Some titanium parts may use **PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition)** for colour (e.g., gold tone).  
- PVD is durable but **not permanent**; wear varies with abrasion, chemicals, skin pH, and handling.

### 2.4 NICKEL & ALLERGIES
- Items intended for prolonged skin contact are designed to comply with the **EN 1811** nickel-release limits.  
- Sensitivities vary by individual; no material is universally “hypoallergenic.”

### 2.5 TESTING & VERIFICATION (TITANIUM)
- **AURICLE tests the backs/labret posts (the parts that go through the skin) against the ASTM F136 criteria** (and references **ISO 5832-3**) as applicable.  
- **Other titanium jewellery** is **randomly selected for testing** on a periodic basis.  
- For product-specific questions, contact **info@auricle.co.uk** before ordering.

> For care and handling, follow any guidance on the product page. Contact **info@auricle.co.uk** with material queries before ordering.

## 3. MIXED-MATERIAL PRODUCTS

Jewellery may combine gold elements and non-precious components (e.g., gold decorative fronts with titanium backs/bars). Descriptions on product pages identify the relevant parts and materials. Where mixed materials are used, hallmarking applies **only to the precious-metal parts** (see §4).

---

## 4. UK HALLMARKING (SUMMARY)

### 4.1 WHEN HALLMARKING APPLIES
Under the UK Hallmarking Act, articles **described as precious metal** must be **hallmarked by a UK Assay Office** when they exceed statutory weight thresholds (examples):
- **Gold:** items **over 1.0 g** require a hallmark.  
- Items at or below the threshold are **exempt** from compulsory hallmarking.

### 4.2 WHAT A UK HALLMARK INCLUDES
Where applied, a UK hallmark typically includes:
- **Sponsor’s mark** (registered responsibility mark),  
- **Fineness mark** (e.g., **585** for 14K), and  
- **Assay Office mark** (e.g., London, Birmingham, Sheffield, Edinburgh).  
A date letter may be used at the Assay Office’s discretion.

### 4.3 TINY PARTS & LASER MARKS
Due to the **small size** of body jewellery, the hallmark may be:
- **Laser-applied** on a suitable surface, or  
- Omitted where the item is **below the legal weight threshold** or **technically unsuitable** for marking.  
Where only part of a mixed-material article is precious metal, the hallmark appears **on that precious-metal part** if feasible.

### 4.4 TITANIUM & OTHER NON-PRECIOUS METALS
Titanium components are **not** hallmarked (not precious metal under UK law). Where a product includes both precious and non-precious parts, the hallmark, if any, relates to the **precious-metal portion only**.
