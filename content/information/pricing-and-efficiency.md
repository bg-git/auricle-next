It’s true, our prices are low. We check the industry constantly, but only after the quality is the best it can be. Quality first, price second. A lean team, tight catalogue, small rolling inventory, no gimmicks, no tree planting, no monthly sales, and no heavy ad spend keep costs out of the jewellery price. We grow with our clients and make commercial pieces that sell, no dust collectors, no niche stones.

## Lean structure
- Small team, low payroll, no layers of management.
- New and focused: no legacy systems or sunk-cost habits.
- Direct to studio (trade-only), which reduces support overheads.

## Focused catalogue
- Only jewellery that sells—no dust collectors.
- Commercial designs first; no novelty shapes or stone layouts with narrow appeal.
- Tight SKU discipline; small inventory held, replenished in frequent drops.
- Shared components across variants (pin spec, seats, stone sizes) to reduce tooling and variance.

## Manufacturing & QC efficiency
- Threadless-first simplifies production and fit across sizes.
- Standardised tolerances and gauges across families.
- Batch QC geared to studio use: pin fit, seating, and finish—fewer returns, less waste.
- Supplier relationships kept short and direct; no middle layers.

## Tech & operations
- Intuitive website; fast, searchable, no heavy portal costs.
- Automation where it helps (stock, ETAs, data exports); no custom “platform” bloat.
- Digital assets built once, reused across channels (consistent 4:5 imagery, clean metadata).

## Packaging & logistics
- Simple, protective, recyclable packaging—no velvet boxes or display theatrics.
- Consolidated freight and small, frequent restocks to avoid holding costs.
- Straightforward shipping; no padded “handling” fees.

## Pricing choices
- No monthly sales or coupon cycles.
- No paid influencers, sponsorships, or prize pots.
- No tree-planting add-ons masked in unit cost.
- Just stable, low pricing built on lean overheads.

## How we scale
- Growth paced with studio demand; inventory expands with sell-through.
- Variants added by request where there’s clear need.
- Core lines kept in rotation for predictable re-orders.

## What we do spend on
- Premium materials: 14k gold and ASTM F-136 titanium.
- Tight tolerances, secure settings, and finish work that reduces rework.
- Accurate data and media so products load quickly and sell faster.

**Bottom line:** small team, focused range, standardised build, and zero gimmicks. Costs stay out of the price; quality stays in.
