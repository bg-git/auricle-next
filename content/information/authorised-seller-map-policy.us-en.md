<div className="information-page">

**Effective Date:** 9 August 2025

> **NON-NEGOTIABLE POLICY:** Authorisation to resell AURICLE products and to use our brand assets requires compliance with this policy, including the rules relating to **Minimum Advertised Price (MAP)**. If you do not accept these conditions, you must not resell AURICLE products. Further information is available in the [TERMS OF SALE](/information/terms-of-sale), [TERMS OF SERVICE](/information/terms-of-service) and [DESIGNS & IP](/information/design-copyright-ip-notice).

---

## 1. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY

Our published **Recommended Retail Price (RRP)** is listed on each product page. Unless stated otherwise in writing, **RRP equals MAP** for that item.  
MAP applies only to **publicly advertised prices**. You remain fully free to set your actual resale price at any level.  
This policy is a **unilateral condition of authorisation and supply**. It is not an agreement to fix resale pricing.

---

## 2. WHO IS COVERED

This policy applies to all customers who resell AURICLE branded products, whether online or offline, including distributors and retailers who use AURICLE images, product copy or trademarks.  
Authorisation may be withdrawn where a reseller does not comply with this policy.

---

## 3. WHAT COUNTS AS A PUBLICLY ADVERTISED PRICE

A publicly advertised price is any price visible without a one-to-one quote. This includes:

• Product pages or listing pages that load without login  
• Printed catalogues, store signage, public leaflets or displays  
• Social media posts, adverts, Google Shopping feeds and Meta placements  
• Marketplace listings such as Amazon, eBay or Etsy  
• Public voucher codes, automatic discount banners or general promotions visible to the public

Examples that do **not** count as publicly advertised: private emails to individual clients, negotiated trade lists sent directly to a single business, and pricing that is visible only after logging into a restricted trade portal.

If unsure whether something is public, treat it as public.

---

## 4. MAP RULE

Resellers must not advertise an AURICLE product at a level below the RRP or MAP displayed on our product page, unless we confirm a different MAP in writing.  
“Below” includes any effective public price after automatic discounts, stackable vouchers or promotional bundles that reduce the public-facing per-unit value below MAP.  
You may use “POA” (price on application) or hide pricing on public pages.  
Temporary promotions at or above MAP are permitted.

---

## 5. FREEDOM TO SET YOUR ACTUAL SALE PRICE

This policy applies to **advertised** price only.  
Your actual transactional sale price is entirely your decision. We do not request, encourage or accept any agreement regarding your final resale pricing.

---

## 6. ONLINE MARKETPLACES AND ADVERTISING

Listing AURICLE products on third-party marketplaces may require prior written approval.  
Where approval is given, marketplace listings and shopping feed data must comply with MAP.  
Resellers must not bid on AURICLE trademarks or close variations of them in search adverts without written permission.

---

## 7. BRAND ASSETS AND CONTENT

Use of AURICLE product images, written content and logos is subject to the [DESIGNS & IP](/information/design-copyright-ip-notice) policy.  
We may withdraw permission to use brand assets or require removal of listings where MAP is breached or where brand misuse occurs.

---

## 8. MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT

We reserve the right to monitor public channels, shopping feeds and comparison platforms.  
If a breach is identified, we may take one or more of the following steps:

1. Request that the reseller corrects the issue within a specified timeframe  
2. Suspend access to brand assets and remove the reseller from our authorised list  
3. Suspend discounts, cancel pending orders or suspend or terminate the account in cases of repeated or serious breaches  

Decisions made under this policy are final.

---

## 9. COMPETITION LAW

Nothing in this policy requires a reseller to sell at any specific final price.  
The policy governs public advertising only.  
Resellers are encouraged to seek independent legal advice where appropriate.
