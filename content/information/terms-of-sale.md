## Online Security

This assures you the website is secure and your identity has been authenticated to the industry’s highest standard. When you see the padlock in the address bar you can be confident to proceed and complete your transaction.

When you shop with us or communicate your personal details to our payment system, HTTPS allows all personal information, such as your credit card number, to be encrypted as it travels from one designated place to the next. Once received, the information is unencrypted and processed. At no time is your credit card number stored on our website or in our online database.

## Purchasing Products

This wholesale website offers products to legitimate businesses and does not sell to the general public. To purchase products from the website, you will be required to register an account before gaining access to pricing.

You can purchase our products through our online checkout process or by an authorised retailer.

Our shopping pages will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order with us through our website. Our order process allows you to check and amend your order before submitting it to us. Please take the time to read and check your order at each stage of the process.

After placing an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted by us. We reserve the right at all times and at our sole discretion to refuse to accept any orders. If we are unable to supply you with a product, we will inform you by e-mail and will refund your order.

---

## Payments

You can only pay for products using a debit card or credit card. We do not accept Amazon Pay, PayPal, WeChat Pay, Alipay, Klarna or any other third party platform.

Payment for products and all applicable charges will be taken at the time of ordering.

Our prices may be subject to change without notice.

US Dollar and Euro prices quoted are for informational purposes only and are approximate. Your credit card company will convert our Sterling prices into your local currency using their own exchange rate at the time of purchase.

---

## Returns, Cancellations & Refunds

This website is exempt from Consumer Contracts (formerly distance selling) regulations. A 'cooling off period' is not applicable.

To inform us of a faulty product, email us at info@auricle.co.uk detailing the fault.

In the rare circumstance where a product is faulty, we will provide a like-for-like exchange. Faulty items must be returned to us within 7 days of notifying us.

Our returns policies do not affect your statutory rights.

---

## Shipping & Delivery

Shipping times and charges are provided during the checkout process depending on the destination delivery address and before you are asked to confirm your order. However, delivery times are subject to parts availability, third party services such as delivery service companies, and to possible delays due to credit card authorisation, compliance with customs controls and other factors outside of our control. We will advise you as soon as practicable if there is a delay or likelihood of delay in the supply of your products.

We can only ship to countries featured on our shipping list seen during the checkout process. Please note that we do not ship to PO Boxes.

If an incorrect destination country is selected during the checkout process, or the address entered doesn't correspond to the country selected, we will cancel your order and notify you by e-mail. In the interest of security, we reserve the right to dispatch the product(s) on this website to the billing address belonging to the credit card used as payment and not to the nominated delivery address supplied by you.

You will need to ensure somebody is available to sign for receipt of the products at the delivery address. If there is nobody at the delivery address to take delivery and sign for the products, you can contact the courier to arrange a new delivery time. We cannot be responsible for any delivery problems arising from incomplete or incorrect address details supplied by you.

Delivery of an order shall be completed when we deliver your products to the address detailed in your order and the products will be your responsibility from that time. You own the products once we have received payment in full, including all applicable delivery charges.

## Product Prices

The prices displayed on this website are quoted in GBP and are subject to VAT at 20% (UK Tax). VAT at 20% is shown separately on the checkout pages.

Products that are to be delivered outside of the UK will have VAT deduction applied within the checkout when a valid delivery address is entered. Packages will be sent DDU/DAP (Delivery Duty Unpaid). Import duties and taxes may apply and will be invoiced directly to you from the courier or an import broker.

All prices exclude postage and packaging, which will be charged at the rates advised during checkout before you confirm your order.
