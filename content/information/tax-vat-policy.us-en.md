**Effective Date:** 9 August 2025

> **NON NEGOTIABLE POLICY:** Tax treatment, import rules and invoicing are applied exactly as described in this Tax and Import Policy. If you do not accept these terms, do not place an order. For related rules, see the [TERMS OF SALE](/information/terms-of-sale) and the [SHIPPING AND DELIVERY POLICY](/information/shipping-and-delivery-policy).

---

## 1. Scope

This policy applies to all B2B purchases from AURICLE made through our websites or by invoice.  
Website use is governed by the [TERMS OF SERVICE](/information/terms-of-service).

---

## 2. Domestic tax treatment

• For US customers who receive shipments inside the United States, product prices on our site are shown in **USD** or converted from GBP for guidance  
• Any applicable **state or local sales tax** may be applied at checkout, depending on your jurisdiction  
• AURICLE does not collect or remit sales tax for states where marketplace or seller requirements do not apply  

Sales tax rules vary by state and are applied based on the delivery address provided.

---

## 3. International orders delivered outside the US

• Shipments delivered outside the United States follow the same general export rules used for other non UK destinations  
• UK VAT is not charged when a valid non UK delivery address is provided  
• You act as the importer of record in the destination country and are responsible for local duties and taxes  
• Most imports outside the UK follow DAP or DDU terms as outlined in section 4

---

## 4. Duties, import taxes and customs

### 4.1 General DAP and DDU terms

For destinations outside the United States:

• Import taxes, customs duties, brokerage fees and local charges are payable by you  
• Customs inspections can delay shipments and are not under our control  
• If you decline or fail to pay required import charges, the carrier may return or destroy the shipment  
• Any resulting return, storage or re shipping fees are your responsibility

See the [SHIPPING AND DELIVERY POLICY](/information/shipping-and-delivery-policy) for carrier information.

### 4.2 United States specific treatment (post de minimis removal)

Following the removal of the US de minimis threshold, **all commercial imports entering the United States may be subject to duties and taxes, regardless of value**, and **full customs clearance is required**.

To support compliance and to avoid the parcel being held at the border:

• **Duties and taxes are calculated and collected at checkout**  
• These amounts are used to pay or arrange payment of US import duties and taxes so the shipment can clear customs  
• You remain the importer of record  
• You are responsible for additional duties or taxes if classification or valuation changes occur during US Customs review  
• If duties are unpaid or information is incomplete, US Customs may hold, return or dispose of the shipment, and associated charges remain your responsibility

---

## 5. Pricing, currency and display

• Product prices are shown primarily in **GBP**; USD figures may appear for convenience  
• USD amounts shown are estimates and may vary based on your card provider  
• Exchange rates are determined by your payment provider at the time of processing  
• Shipping costs are displayed during checkout before you confirm your order

---

## 6. Invoices and documentation

• A commercial invoice is issued for all shipments to the United States  
• The invoice states the true value of the goods and the appropriate HS codes  
• We do not undervalue shipments or label them as gifts  
• If a return is authorized, we issue a credit note that references the original invoice

---

## 7. Tax identifiers

• We may request your business tax ID or importer identification number to support compliant US import processing  
• Missing or incorrect identifiers can delay customs clearance and may create additional charges that are your responsibility

---

## 8. Freight forwarders and indirect exports

• If you use a US based freight forwarder or re ship items to another country, you are responsible for any resulting duties, taxes or administrative requirements  
• We cannot apply tax exempt treatment without adequate documentation where required by law

---

## 9. Errors, corrections and compliance

• If pricing or tax presentation errors occur due to human or system error, we may correct or cancel the order and refund any affected amounts  
• We may request information needed to satisfy tax or import compliance requirements and may delay or cancel shipments until the information is provided

---

## 10. Record keeping and retention

We retain transaction records, invoices and customs documentation for the periods required by law for tax and audit obligations.

---

Updates to this policy take effect once published on this page.
