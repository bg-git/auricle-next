It is true: our prices are low. We track the industry constantly, but only after we are confident the quality is the best it can be. Quality comes first, price comes second. A lean team, a tight catalogue, small rolling inventory, no gimmicks, no environmental add-ons, no monthly promotions, and no heavy advertising spend keep unnecessary cost out of the jewellery price. We grow with our clients and produce commercial pieces that sell. No products that gather dust and no niche stones with limited appeal.

## Lean structure

• Small team with low payroll and no management layers  
• Built recently and intentionally, without legacy systems or old habits  
• Direct to studio trade model, reducing support overheads

## Focused catalogue

• Only jewellery that sells, nothing that sits in drawers  
• Commercial designs take priority; no novelty shapes or stones with narrow demand  
• Controlled SKU count with small inventory that is restocked in frequent cycles  
• Shared components across variants, such as consistent pin specification and stone sizes, reducing tooling complexity and variance

## Manufacturing and QC efficiency

• Threadless first approach simplifies production and keeps fit consistent across sizes  
• Standard tolerances and gauges across each product family  
• Batch quality checks aligned with studio use, such as pin fit, seating and finish, leading to fewer returns and less waste  
• Supplier relationships kept short and direct, avoiding unnecessary layers

## Tech and operations

• Intuitive website that is fast and easy to search, without costly portal systems  
• Automation used where it provides genuine value, such as for stock, ETAs and exportable data  
• Digital assets produced once and reused across channels, using the same 4:5 imagery and consistent metadata

## Packaging and logistics

• Simple, protective and recyclable packaging without display extras  
• Consolidated freight and small, frequent restocks to keep holding costs down  
• Straightforward shipping without inflated handling fees

## Pricing choices

• No monthly promotions or constant voucher cycles  
• No paid influencer programs, sponsorships or prize incentives  
• No environmental add-on charges hidden in the unit cost  
• Stable pricing built on lean overheads and efficient structure

## How we scale

• Growth paced with studio demand; inventory expands in line with sell-through  
• Variants added when there is a clear and demonstrated need  
• Core lines kept active to support predictable reorders

## What we do spend on

• Premium materials such as 14k gold and ASTM F-136 titanium  
• Tight tolerances, secure stone settings and finish work that reduces rework  
• Accurate data, consistent photography and structured media that help products load quickly and convert more effectively

**Bottom line:** a small team, a focused range, standardised production and no gimmicks. Costs stay out of the price. Quality stays in.
