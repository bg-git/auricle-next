<div class="information-page">

**Effective Date:** 9 August 2025

> **NON NEGOTIABLE POLICY:** VAT treatment, export rules and invoicing are applied exactly as described in this Tax and VAT Policy. If you do not accept these terms, do not place an order. For related information, see the [TERMS OF SALE](/information/terms-of-sale) and the [SHIPPING & DELIVERY POLICY](/information/shipping-and-delivery-policy).

---

## 1. Scope

This policy applies to all B2B purchases from AURICLE made through our website or by invoice.  
Website use is governed by the [TERMS OF SERVICE](/information/terms-of-service).

---

## 2. UK VAT (domestic supplies)

• For deliveries within the United Kingdom, prices are shown in **GBP** and are subject to **UK VAT at 20 percent**, unless a lawful zero rate applies  
• VAT is displayed as a separate amount at checkout and on your invoice  
• Northern Ireland is treated as part of the UK VAT area for supplies from us  

Domestic reverse charge rules do not apply to our supply of goods.

---

## 3. Exports outside the UK (EU and rest of world)

### 3.1 General exports

• For deliveries outside the UK, UK VAT is removed at checkout when a valid non UK delivery address is entered  
• International orders are normally shipped under DAP or DDU terms, as described in section 4  
• You act as the importer of record and are responsible for any import VAT and duties payable in the destination country  

### 3.2 United States specific position

Following the removal of the US de minimis threshold, **all commercial imports into the United States may be subject to duties and taxes, regardless of value**, and **full customs clearance is required**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

To reduce delays and align with updated carrier and customs practices, for orders shipped to US addresses:

• Duties and taxes are **calculated and charged at checkout**, based on the information you provide  
• These amounts are used to pay, or arrange payment of, the relevant US import duties and taxes so that the shipment can clear customs without the consignee being billed later  
• You remain responsible for any additional duties, taxes or fees assessed by US authorities if information supplied for classification or valuation is incomplete or inaccurate :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

Where duties and taxes are collected in advance for US shipments, this does not change your status as importer of record. It means that AURICLE or our carrier pays or arranges payment on your behalf to allow customs clearance.

## 4. Duties, import VAT and brokerage

### 4.1 General DAP and DDU terms

For most destinations outside the UK:

• Import VAT, customs duties, brokerage charges and local taxes are payable by you to the carrier or your local authority  
• Customs inspections may cause delays that are outside our control  
• If you refuse or fail to pay import charges, the shipment may be returned or destroyed by the carrier  
• Any return, storage, re shipping or destruction costs are your responsibility  

See the [SHIPPING AND DELIVERY POLICY](/information/shipping-and-delivery-policy) for carrier information.

### 4.2 US shipments with prepaid duties

For US shipments where duties and taxes are charged at checkout:

• The amounts collected at checkout represent estimated import charges based on the data supplied  
• These funds are used to settle, or help settle, US import duties and taxes so that the shipment can clear customs  
• If the actual amounts assessed by US Customs differ from the estimate, you are responsible for any shortfall and will receive the benefit of any overpayment through adjustment or credit where practicable  

---

## 5. Pricing, currency and display

• Prices are shown in **GBP**  
• Any USD or EUR amounts displayed are approximate and for guidance only  
• Your card or payment provider determines the exchange rate at the time of charge  
• All prices exclude shipping costs; delivery charges are shown at checkout before you confirm the order  

---

## 6. VAT invoices and documentation

• A VAT invoice is issued for supplies that are subject to UK VAT  
• For exports, we issue a commercial invoice and customs documentation that states the true value of the goods and the relevant HS codes  
• We do not undervalue shipments or mark items as gifts  
• For authorised returns or adjustments, we issue credit notes that refer to the original invoice  

---

## 7. Tax identifiers (VAT and EORI)

• We may request your VAT number and, where relevant, your EORI number to support compliant invoicing and customs clearance  
• Incorrect, incomplete or missing identifiers may cause delays or extra costs, which are your responsibility  

---

## 8. Freight forwarders and indirect exports

• If you export goods using a UK based freight forwarder, or collect goods in the UK for onward export, zero rating may depend on receiving valid proof of export within the required timeframes  
• Where sufficient evidence is not provided, we may need to charge UK VAT or re issue invoices to reflect the correct treatment  

---

## 9. Errors, corrections and compliance

• If pricing or tax presentation errors arise due to human or system error, we may correct or cancel affected orders and refund any amounts paid  
• We may request reasonable information needed to meet VAT or export compliance requirements and may delay or cancel shipments until it is received  

---

## 10. Record keeping and retention

We retain transactional records, including invoices and export evidence, for statutory periods to satisfy tax and audit requirements.

---

## 11. Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes take effect when published on this page.
