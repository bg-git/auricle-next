AURICLE is officially live. This boutique **wholesale piercing jewellery brand** is already gaining traction with professional piercers across the UK and Europe. We sat down with the team to explore what AURICLE is, why it exists, and what makes it different.



### Who is AURICLE for?

**AURICLE:**  
We created AURICLE for **professional piercers and studio owners** who are tired of overpriced brands and cluttered catalogues. AURICLE is wholesale-only — no public sales — and every piece is designed to move quickly, wear beautifully, and work with professional setups.

We cater to **piercing studios, boutiques, and retailers** looking for something dainty, minimal, and easy to sell.



### What makes AURICLE different?

**AURICLE:**  
We’re **wholesale-only** — but with none of the usual headaches.  
No 6-week lead times. No inflated MOQs. Just **limited-run, fast-moving jewellery** that piercers actually want to stock.

Everything ships from the UK, with low minimums, no bloat, and quick restocks. We focus on clean visuals, curated collections, and **clear pricing that respects your margins**.



### What’s your design approach?

**AURICLE:**  
Less is more. We specialise in **minimal, dainty body jewellery** — marquise clusters, bead ends, flat chains, opals, and clean shapes. Everything is designed to complement curated ears and healed or fresh piercings.

We don’t try to please everyone — just **studios who care about quality and simplicity**.



### Why wholesale only?

**AURICLE:**  
Because we know who we serve: **piercers, not consumers**.  
We support the studios. That means clean B2B pricing, studio-focused designs, and no competing with your customers online.

We’ve worked with enough suppliers to know what slows things down. AURICLE is built to be fast, lean, and reliable — just how you need your **jewellery supplier** to be.



### What materials do you use?

**AURICLE:**  
We offer two core lines:  
- **14k solid gold**, nickel-safe and UK-hallmarked  
- **ASTM F136 implant-grade titanium** — polished, clean, and professional  

Everything we make is built with quality in mind. No mystery metals. No plating. No drop shipping.



### What are your MOQs and lead times?

**AURICLE:**  
Low MOQs, fast turnaround. We’re a **boutique wholesaler**, so we keep things small and streamlined. Most orders ship within 48 hours from our UK dispatch centre.

Our goal is to help you **stay in stock with jewellery that actually sells** — not lock you into huge bulk orders that sit in drawers.



### What’s next?

**AURICLE:**  
We’re expanding. More titanium. More gold. More thoughtful designs. We’re already stocked in a number of UK and EU studios, and we're onboarding new **wholesale partners** each week.

If you're a **professional piercer looking for a fresh supplier**, we’d love to chat.
