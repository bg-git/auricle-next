## Smoothly does it

In piercing, a mirror finish is used to describe jewellery that has been polished to a very high level of smoothness, intended to minimise friction against the skin and healing tissue.

While this has traditionally been judged by visual appearance, surface quality can also be defined and verified using measurable surface roughness values, typically expressed as Ra or Ru.

In piercing, surface finish matters because it directly affects how jewellery interacts with the skin and healing tissue. A smoother surface, with lower roughness values, reduces microscopic peaks and valleys that can contribute to irritation during wear.

At AURICLE, mirror finish is treated as a measurable property, not a subjective description. For that reason, mirror-finished titanium jewellery is independently spot-tested using surface roughness measurement to verify that finished pieces meet defined Ra or Ru roughness expectations.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE mirror-finished jewellery is supported by objective surface roughness verification rather than visual assessment alone, with supporting evidence in place.
