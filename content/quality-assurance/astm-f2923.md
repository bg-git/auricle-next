### Did you know?

While ASTM F136 defines implant-grade titanium, it does not determine whether finished jewellery is suitable for children, specifically under the age of 12 years.

ASTM F2923 evaluates finished jewellery quality intended for children, including material safety, surface finish, and real-world use, recognising that suitability cannot be assumed from material grade or mill certificates alone.

## Children’s Jewellery Safety

ASTM F2923 is a standard used to assess whether jewellery intended to be worn by children under the age of 12 is safe, alongside other consumer safety considerations.

Child safety should always come first, and we understand the importance of being able to demonstrate to clients that the jewellery being used on their children is safe for its intended use.

At AURICLE, jewellery safety and quality are taken very seriously. For that reason, titanium jewellery is spot-tested to ASTM F2923 to confirm that finished pieces meet recognised safety expectations for child wear.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery has been assessed against an established children’s jewellery safety standard and that supporting evidence exists.
