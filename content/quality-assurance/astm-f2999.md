## Adult Jewellery Safety | Adults Need Protection Too

ASTM F2999 is a standard used to assess whether jewellery intended to be worn by adults is safe, alongside other consumer safety considerations.

As piercers, we already understand the importance of being able to demonstrate to clients that the jewellery used in their piercings is safe to wear, not simply assumed to be safe.

At AURICLE, jewellery safety is taken seriously. For that reason, titanium jewellery is spot-tested to ASTM F2999 to confirm that finished pieces meet recognised safety expectations for adult wear.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery has been assessed against an established adult jewellery safety standard and that supporting evidence exists.

Further information on the ASTM F2999 adult jewellery safety standard is available from the issuing body via
