## The Real Medical Implant Grade Titanium

ASTM F136 is a material specification used to define implant-grade titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V ELI), including permitted composition, impurity limits, and material consistency.

In piercing, material quality cannot be assumed. Being able to demonstrate what the jewellery is made from, and that it meets a recognised implant-grade specification, is fundamental to client safety and professional practice.

At AURICLE, titanium is verified to ASTM F136 through independent third-party testing at both ingot stage and finished jewellery stage. This confirms that the material specification is maintained throughout manufacture and that the jewellery supplied still meets the ASTM F136 requirements.

### Mill Certificates
 
Mill certificates are self-declared documents issued by the material producer. For that reason, AURICLE does not rely on mill certification alone. Independent testing is required to verify material composition at source and to confirm that the finished jewellery continues to meet the same implant-grade specification.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery is manufactured from titanium that has been independently verified against an established implant-grade material standard, with supporting evidence in place.

### Did you know?

ASTM F136 standard titanium is medical implant grade, developed for use inside the human body and widely used in medical applications worldwide.

For this reason, professional piercers choose ASTM F136 standard titanium when applying medical-adjacent standards to piercing jewellery, supported by independent third-party verification to ensure compliance.
