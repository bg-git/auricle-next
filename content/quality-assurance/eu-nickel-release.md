## UK & EU Legal Requirement

EU nickel release testing is a legal requirement used to assess whether jewellery intended for prolonged contact with the skin releases nickel above permitted limits in the UK and EU.

While implant-grade titanium is not intentionally alloyed with nickel, UK and EU consumer product law still requires nickel release testing when jewellery is placed on the market. Compliance cannot be assumed based on material type alone and must be demonstrated on the finished jewellery.

At AURICLE, finished jewellery is tested for EU nickel release to confirm that it meets the legally defined limits applicable within the UK and EU markets.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery complies with UK and EU nickel release requirements, with supporting evidence in place.
