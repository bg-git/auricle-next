## UK & EU Legal Requirement

EU nickel release testing is a legal requirement used to assess whether jewellery intended for prolonged contact with the skin releases nickel above permitted limits in the UK and EU.

While implant-grade titanium is not intentionally alloyed with nickel, UK and EU consumer product law still requires nickel release testing when jewellery is placed on the market. Compliance cannot be assumed based on material type alone and must be demonstrated on the finished jewellery.

At AURICLE, finished jewellery is tested for EU nickel release to confirm that it meets the legally defined limits applicable within the UK and EU markets.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery complies with UK and EU nickel release requirements, with supporting evidence in place.

### Did you know?

In the UK and EU, nickel release limits are a legal requirement for jewellery intended for prolonged skin contact, including piercing jewellery.

This requirement applies regardless of material, including ASTM F136 titanium.

Mill certificates and material grades alone do not demonstrate legal compliance. Nickel release compliance is determined by the performance of the finished jewellery, as supplied and worn.

Assuming jewellery is compliant simply because it is described as "implant grade", "titanium", "peer verified", or widely used can unintentionally place piercers at risk of supplying jewellery that has not been legally verified under UK and EU consumer product safety law.
