## A United States Framework

The Association of Professional Piercers (APP) is a highly respected United States–based, peer-led organisation that supports education, best practice, and high standards within the piercing industry.

Its guidance and frameworks operate within the United States regulatory environment and reflect the legislation, procurement rules, and professional expectations that apply in the US market. In practical terms, this is similar to how FDA, UKCA, and CE frameworks all serve the same purpose, protecting public safety, while operating under their own country's legal systems and jurisdictions.

UK and EU jewellery supply is governed by UK and EU consumer product law, legislation, and standards that differ from those in the United States. As a result, regulatory requirements, verification routes, and compliance frameworks are not interchangeable across countries.

### UKAPP | United Kingdom Association of Professional Piercers

This jurisdictional distinction is also why organisations such as the UK Association of Professional Piercers (UKAPP) exist, to support professional standards within the UK market and to reflect UK-specific regulatory, legal, and professional contexts. This helps ensure that studios, standards, and piercers are operating within the framework that applies to their own country.

At AURICLE, jewellery compliance is assessed under the legal and regulatory frameworks that apply to where the jewellery is supplied (UK & EU). For UK and EU markets, this means aligning with UK and EU consumer product law and medical-adjacent requirements relevant to professional piercing jewellery.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery is assessed against UK and EU standards and legal requirements, providing assurance that compliance is aligned with the regulatory framework that applies to UK studios and piercers, rather than frameworks designed for other jurisdictions.
