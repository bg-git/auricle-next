## A United Kingdom Framework

The UK Association of Professional Piercers is a UK-based, peer-led association that supports education, best practice, and high standards within the UK piercing industry.

UKAPP’s guidance and verification frameworks are designed to support professional studio practice within the United Kingdom. This includes hygiene, training, professional conduct, and responsible piercing, reflecting the regulatory, legal, and professional environment that applies within the UK market.

UKAPP operates alongside UK consumer product and market legislation, providing peer-led guidance and professional standards for studios and practitioners, rather than acting as a statutory regulatory body.

AURICLE has contacted UKAPP to engage with its jewellery verification scheme and to seek clarification on alignment and requirements. At the time of writing, correspondence has taken place and dialogue is ongoing.

### Ongoing Compliance

In the meantime, AURICLE jewellery continues to be assessed and supplied in accordance with applicable UK and EU legal requirements, supported by independent third-party material testing and finished-product verification.

At AURICLE, jewellery compliance is assessed under the legal and regulatory frameworks that apply to where the jewellery is supplied. For UK and EU markets, this means alignment with UK and EU consumer product law and medical-adjacent requirements relevant to professional piercing jewellery.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery is legally compliant for use within the UK and EU, while remaining aligned with the regulatory framework that applies to UK studios and piercers, and open to engagement with UKAPP where appropriate.
