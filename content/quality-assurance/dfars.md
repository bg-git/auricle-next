## A Military Procurement Framework

DFARS (Defence Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) is a United States military procurement framework used to control sourcing and supply chains for defence and government contracts.

It is designed to regulate where materials are sourced from for military use, based on geopolitical and national security considerations, rather than to assess material safety or jewellery performance.

DFARS does not form part of UK or EU consumer product law, medical regulation, or jewellery safety legislation.

At AURICLE, DFARS is not used as a compliance requirement. Jewellery supplied by AURICLE is intended for civilian, medical-adjacent use and is assessed under UK and EU consumer safety and material standards relevant to where the jewellery is placed on the market.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery is assessed against standards and legal requirements that apply to professional, medical-adjacent piercing jewellery supplied within the UK and EU, with supporting evidence in place.

Further information on DFARS (Defence Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) is available from the United States government via
