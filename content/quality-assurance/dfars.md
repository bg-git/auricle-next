## A Military Procurement Framework

DFARS (Defence Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) is a United States military procurement framework used to control sourcing and supply chains for defence and government contracts.

It is designed to regulate where materials are sourced from for military use, based on geopolitical and national security considerations, rather than to assess material safety or jewellery performance.

DFARS does not form part of UK or EU consumer product law, medical regulation, or jewellery safety legislation.

At AURICLE, DFARS is not used as a compliance requirement. Jewellery supplied by AURICLE is intended for civilian, medical-adjacent use and is assessed under UK and EU consumer safety and material standards relevant to where the jewellery is placed on the market.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery is assessed against standards and legal requirements that apply to professional, medical-adjacent piercing jewellery supplied within the UK and EU, with supporting evidence in place.

Further information on DFARS (Defence Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) is available from the United States government via

### Did you know?

DFARS exists to manage military risk in the United States of America, not to ensure medical safety.

Its purpose is to secure defence supply chains during wartime. It has no role in determining whether a material is biocompatible, safe for implantation, or suitable for use in healthcare, in the US or globally.

In fact, the United States imports large quantities of ASTM F136 compliant titanium from countries that fall outside of US DFARS regulation, specifically for medical use in its hospitals, including implants and surgical devices.

This alone demonstrates that the US considers DFARS a military framework rather than a medical one, and that it is not a measure of material safety or medical suitability, but a geopolitical sourcing policy applied to defence contracts.
