</p>

## PRODUCT COMPLIANCE

AURICLE is built on a simple principle: **jewellery must be safe first, and beautiful by design**.

Every piece supplied by AURICLE is intended for professional piercing use and everyday wear. Safety and compliance are treated as a legal and ethical responsibility, supported by independent evidence and aligned with the regulatory frameworks that apply to jewellery placed on the market.

## How Safety Is Assessed

Jewellery supplied by AURICLE is assessed and spot-tested, where appropriate, through independent third-party accredited laboratories. Testing and assessment are carried out against recognised material and safety standards relevant to professional piercing jewellery, including:

- **ASTM F136**: verification of implant-grade titanium starting material & finished jewellery material 
- **ASTM F2999**: assessment of finished jewellery intended for adult wear  
- **ASTM F2923**: assessment of finished jewellery intended for use in children under 12  
- **EU Nickel Release**: testing to meet UK and EU consumer product law  

Finished jewellery is assessed as supplied and worn, ensuring that compliance reflects real-world use rather than self certified mill certifiacate declarations alone.

## Legal Framework and Intended Use

AURICLE jewellery is manufactured and supplied for civilian, medical-adjacent piercing use and is placed on the market in accordance with **UK and EU consumer product law**. This legal framework defines the requirements for jewellery to be safely stocked, sold, and used within the UK and EU.

**How We Align With Professional Piercing Associations**

AURICLE aligns its jewellery safety and quality framework with recognised professional piercing associations operating within their respective jurisdictions, including the UK, EU, United States, and Australia.

These organisations provide peer-led guidance on studio practice, hygiene, education, and professional standards, operating alongside statutory product safety legislation. While jewellery safety and legality are defined by applicable national and regional law, professional frameworks play an important role in shaping best practice within the industry.

The associations listed below represent the professional contexts within which AURICLE aligns, supported by evidence-based compliance and independent testing.

<div class="association-card">

### 🇬🇧 National Association of Jewellers (NAJ)

**Who they are:**  
The UK’s leading professional trade association for the jewellery industry.

**What they do:**  
Represent and support jewellery manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, and wholesalers through professional standards, ethical guidance, industry governance, and advocacy.

**Jurisdiction:**  
United Kingdom.

**Alignment:** <span class="status-icon status-green">✔</span>

**Rationale:**  
The National Association of Jewellers operates at the core of the UK jewellery industry, setting expectations around professionalism, transparency, responsible supply, and ethical trading. Its framework aligns with UK consumer law and recognised industry best practice for jewellery placed on the UK market.

Membership reflects a commitment to operating responsibly within the UK jewellery sector.

**Verdict:**  
AURICLE is a registered wholesale member of the National Association of Jewellers and is proud to align with its professional and ethical standards. This membership reinforces AURICLE’s position as a UK-based supplier operating within established industry frameworks, supported by evidence-based compliance and responsible supply practices.

### 🇺🇸 The Association of Professional Piercers (APP)

**Who they are:**  
United States based professional piercing association.

**What they do:**  
Provide education, studio standards, peer verification, and jewellery guidance, including material benchmarks and sourcing policies.

**Jurisdiction:**  
United States.

**Alignment:** ❌

**Rationale:**  
The Association of Professional Piercers (APP) defines professional expectations for piercing jewellery in the United States, including the use of implant-grade materials manufactured to recognised ASTM standards.

Beyond governing law, APP guidance also incorporates additional DFARS (Defence Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) requirements. DFARS is a United States defence procurement framework and is geopolitical by nature, and sits outside statutory consumer product safety law in the US and medical-adjacent material requirements applied internationally.

**Verdict:**  
While AURICLE exceeds applicable United States legal requirements and recognised material safety standards for piercing jewellery in regional states. Our APP non-alignment relates to additional military policy rather than jewellery safety or biocompatibility. Hopefully this will change in the future.

### 🇬🇧 UK Association of Professional Piercers (UKAPP)

**Who they are:**  
UK based professional piercing association.

**Verdict:**  
AURICLE exceeds statutory UK and EU legal requirements for jewellery safety and aligns with UKAPP’s published material criteria through independent third-party material testing and finished-product verification, providing evidence beyond supplier documentation alone. 

As a UK company, AURICLE is keen to work with, support, and champion UKAPP, and intends to progress verification once alignment criteria are confirmed within the UK and EU legal framework.

Professional piercing associations play an important role in shaping best practice, education, and studio standards within their respective regions. These peer-led frameworks operate alongside, but separately from, statutory consumer product safety law, which ultimately governs how jewellery may be placed on the market.

AURICLE’s compliance framework is grounded first in UK and EU consumer product legislation, supported by independent third-party testing and finished-product verification. Where professional association guidance aligns with this legal framework, AURICLE aligns with it.

As a UK company, AURICLE recognises the importance of UKAPP within the UK piercing industry and has initiated engagement to clarify verification alignment within the UK and EU legal context. Progression will follow once criteria are confirmed.

This enables studios to state, with confidence, that AURICLE jewellery is assessed and supplied in accordance with applicable UK and EU product safety legislation, supported by independent testing and appropriate documentation.
