## The Source of Truth

Mill certificates are self-declared documents provided by the material producer (the mill) to state that the material they intended to produce was produced successfully, in our case, Ti-6Al-4V ELI (ASTM F136) titanium. This applies before the material is transformed into jewellery.

At AURICLE, self-declared mill certificates are **not accepted** as evidence of material compliance. Independent third-party testing of the titanium ingot or rod is required to verify the starting material against the ASTM F136 specification.

Once the jewellery is complete and fully finished, AURICLE independently spot-tests the finished jewellery again through third-party testing. This confirms that the jewellery being used on clients continues to meet the ASTM F136 material specification.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that the AURICLE jewellery they are using is supported by independent material verification rather than self-certified documentation, with supporting evidence in place.
