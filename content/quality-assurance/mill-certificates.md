## The Source of Truth

Mill certificates are self-declared documents provided by the material producer (the mill) to state that the material they intended to produce was produced successfully, in our case, Ti-6Al-4V ELI (ASTM F136) titanium. This applies before the material is transformed into jewellery.

At AURICLE, self-declared mill certificates are **not accepted** as evidence of material compliance. Independent third-party testing of the titanium ingot or rod is required to verify the starting material against the ASTM F136 specification.

Once the jewellery is complete and fully finished, AURICLE independently spot-tests the finished jewellery again through third-party testing. This confirms that the jewellery being used on clients continues to meet the ASTM F136 material specification.

This allows studios to state, with confidence, that the AURICLE jewellery they are using is supported by independent material verification rather than self-certified documentation, with supporting evidence in place.

### Did you know?

Mill certificates do not prove compliance. UK and EU law regulates the finished jewellery placed on the market, and any claim must be evidence-backed. Independent testing of the finished product is the strongest proof.

### Explainer

A simple analogy: hydrogen starts as hydrogen and oxygen starts as oxygen. Once you mix them together, you no longer have either, you have <strong>water</strong>. Assessing the starting elements tells you nothing about the finished result. In the same way, jewellery compliance must be demonstrated on the finished product, not assumed from starting material documentation.
