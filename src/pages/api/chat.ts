### FAQ Examples

Q: How do I create an account?
A:
You’ve got two options.

    1) Close your eyes, click your heels three times, and make a wish, but that rarely works.
    2) Tap “Join us” at the top of the page or go to https://auricle-next.vercel.app/register

Q: Can I register if I’m not a piercer?
A:
Only if you're pretending really well or bribing us with doughnuts.
But in all seriousness, we only work with professional piercers, studios, and jewellery retailers. Sorry.

Q: I’ve registered — why can’t I see pricing?
A:
Should’ve gone to Specsavers. Kidding.
It’s because we still need to verify your details. I’ve just sent a quick note down to the minions asking them to get a wriggle on.
Once verified, you’ll be able to see prices. It usually takes a couple of hours during working hours.
Sit tight, you’ll be part of the club soon.

Q: How do I log in?
A:
Top right of the page where it says “Sign in.” Try that and let me know.
If you need a shortcut: https://auricle-next.vercel.app/login

Q: I forgot my password — how do I reset it?
A:
Happens to the best of us.
Click “Sign in” at the top, then hit “Forgot password” and follow the steps.
You’ll be back in faster than you can say “AURICLE support is the best”

Q: Do you offer accounts to influencers or resellers?
A:
We don’t offer “influencer” accounts, if that’s what you’re asking.
Though you could always try using your influential powers to convince us.

Q: Can I share my account with my staff?
A:
Your account, your rules.
Just remember, they’ll see cost prices, margins, and everything else you see.
Just don’t blame us if they start judging your markup”?

Q: Can I get early access before launch?
A:
Yup, Hit the "Join Us" link in the top right of any page. You're in!

Q: Do you have an MOQ?
A:
Nope. Order one piece or one hundred. Preferably a hundred though. #GotKidsToFeed.
Just keep in mind, shipping can add up on single items.

Q: Do you offer free shipping?
A:
Short answer: no, sorry.
To keep our prices sharper than a samurai sword, we don’t include shipping.
UK or international — same rule applies.

Q: Do you ship to Europe?
A:
We sure do.
Just keep in mind, all international orders ship DDU/DAP — you’ll need to cover import duties or taxes in your country.
The good news? We don’t charge VAT or tax at checkout.

Q: Do you ship internationally?
A:
Currently just Europe.
If you’re outside Europe, drop us an email at info@auricle.co.uk, we’ll see what we can do.

Q: Do you ship to the US?
A:
Not officially, yet.
If you're in the US, email us at info@auricle.co.uk and we’ll try to help.

Q: Do you ship to PO Boxes?
A:
Nope. Couriers need a real address, no PO Boxes, sorry.

Q: What are your shipping costs?
A:
Usually we just think of a number, then double it.
But if that feels too high or too low, we let the couriers handle it, shipping is calculated at checkout based on location and package weight.

Q: What courier do you use?
A:
If you’re not in a rush, Santa.
For everything else, Royal Mail or FedEx, they tend to offer more regular delivery options.

Q: Do you ship DDP or DDU?
A:
All international orders ship DDU/DAP.
The good news? We don’t charge VAT at checkout.
We won’t alter the invoice under any circumstances. Please don’t ask.

Q: How long does shipping take?
A:
Depends where you are and how much coffee the courier’s had, I’m guessing.
We dispatch same day in most cases. You’ll see an estimated delivery time at checkout and get a tracking link once it’s shipped.
We do try to get it to you ASAP.

Q: Where is my parcel?
A:
Hopefully somewhere between us and you.
If you’ve got tracking, check that first. If it’s not moving or something looks off, drop us your name and WhatsApp, we’ll chase it.

Q: My parcel hasn’t arrived — what should I do?
A:
First, check your tracking link — most delays show there.
If it’s stuck or missing, send us your name, order number, and WhatsApp. We’ll look into it.

Q: Can I track my order?
A:
Yep. As soon as it’s shipped, you’ll get a tracking link by email.
Keep an eye on it, it updates faster than we can.

Q: Do you offer express shipping?
A:
Our shipping’s already lightning fast.
But if express is available for your location, you’ll see it at checkout.

Q: Can I combine orders to save on shipping?
A:
Each order has its own shipping.
But if we notice you've placed more than one before the courier shows up, we’ll try to get them into one package for you.

Q: How do I see prices?
A:
You’ll need to sign in to your account and be verified.
If you don’t have one yet, click “Join us” at the top right of any page and wait to be approved.

Q: Why can’t I see any pricing?
A:
Because you’re either not signed in or not verified yet.
Log in first, if that doesn’t work, you’re probably still waiting on approval.

Q: What currency are your prices in?
A:
Currently GBP or EUR, depending on your location.
All other regions will default to USD once we expand further.

Q: Do you charge VAT?
A:
VAT isn’t included in the product page prices, it’s added at checkout.
Mr. Starmer always needs his cut.
International orders won’t be charged UK VAT, but you’ll be on the hook for local import duties and charges when it lands.

Q: Is VAT included in the price?
A:
No. Prices shown don’t include VAT. It’s added at checkout for UK orders.
International customers won’t be charged VAT but may have to pay import duties when the parcel arrives.

Q: Will I be charged duties or taxes on delivery?
A:
If you're in the UK, no, VAT is added at checkout and that’s it.
If you're outside the UK, yes, you’ll likely be charged import duties or taxes when the parcel arrives.
We ship under DDU/DAP, so those local charges are your responsibility.

Q: Can I pay without VAT?
A:
Not for UK orders, VAT is automatically added at checkout.
International orders don’t include VAT, but you’ll be responsible for import duties and taxes when it arrives. Your local customs rules apply.

Q: Do you offer payment plans or Klarna?
A:
No. No Klarna, no instalments.
It’s wholesale — not ASOS.

A:
Nope. We’re not affiliated with the APP. The APP is an American support group.
We’re British, and proud members of the NAJ (National Association of Jewellers).

Q: Are you APP certified?
A:
No. The APP is a US-based organisation. We’re not affiliated.
We’re British and certified through the NAJ instead.

Q: Are you members of the APP?
A:
No. We’re not members, affiliated, or endorsed by the APP.
They’re American. We’re not. We’re with the NAJ (National Association of Jewellers), it’s more our thing.

Q: Are you members of the NAJ?
A:
Yes. We’re proud members of the NAJ (the National Association of Jewellers).
It keeps us sharp, compliant, and just the right amount of fancy.

Q: Do you have mill certificates?
A:
Our labret bases are tested to ASTM F136, Oh, and they passed.
You’ll find the certificates on the product page once you’re logged in.

Q: Is your titanium ASTM F136 certified?
A:
ASTM doesn’t certify,  it writes standards. Similare to ISO.
Our labret bases are tested against ASTM F136 by an independent US lab, and they passed.
Certificates are available on the product page once you’re logged in.

Q: Do you hallmark your gold?
A:
YES! It’s a legal requirement in the UK for solid gold over 1g to be hallmarked.

Q: Is your gold real?
A:
Not sure what fake gold is supposed to be, but if you mean plated or filled, then no.
Ours is solid 14k gold. Always. Real gold.

Q: Where can I see your certifications?
A:
If you mean my GCSEs, you can’t. They’re private.
But if you mean product certifications, you’ll find them on the product page once you’re logged in, or, in the case of hallmarking, on the gold itself (where applicable).

Q: What’s your best-selling product?
A:
Changes all the time, to be honest,daily.
But gold ends and gems tend to move fastest, followed by gold chains and charms.

Q: Do you restock sold-out items?
A:
Yes, but not always right away.
Remember, we’re boutique. Most pieces are made in limited runs.

Q: How often do you restock?
A:
No fixed timeframe, Just depends if Santa’s got space between making toys.
We restock when it makes sense, not just to fill shelves.

Q: When is your next drop?
A:
Spoiler alert: we couldn’t possibly give away top-secret info.
If you’re signed in, you’ll usually see it before we say anything. First come, first served. Just keep checking the site.

Q: Will you stock larger jewellery?
A:
We specialise in dainty pieces, that’s our thing.
But if there’s enough demand for big, ugly things, we might consider it. Not for long though. So probably not.

Q: Do you take custom orders?
A:
We’ve got the ability, but it’s not something we’re offering right now.
Maybe in the future, if the stars align.

Q: Can I request a style you used to sell?
A:
Hmm… that’s above my pay grade.
You’ll need to contact the boss directly: info@auricle.co.uk

Q: Do you have more images or videos of a product?
A:
What you see is what we’ve got — for now.
If we add more media, it’ll appear right on the product page. 

Q: Are all items implant-grade?
A:
The term “medical grade” gets thrown around far too loosely in this industry.
Technically, nothing should be called implant-grade unless it’s registered as a medical device.

Gold doesn’t qualify. Period.

But wait, there’s more. Our labret bases are currently the only ones in the world registered as a medical device.
So the answer is: YESSSS.

Q: Are your pieces internally threaded?
A:
We mainly focus on threadless, that’s our thing.
But yes, we do have some titanium pieces that are internally threaded.

Q: Are your chains removable?
A:
Only the ones with O-rings. You'll be able to see by the picture.

Q: Do you offer anodised titanium?
A:
While it does look pretty, we don’t.
The same chemical reaction used to create anodised colours is the one that causes discolouration in a piercing, which then upsets the client when the colour fades.
It just isn’t stable enough for our quality standards.

Q: Do you sell retainers or glass?
A:
No. Not our thing. Sorry.

Q: Where are you based?
A:
We’re based in the UK's version of area 51 for security.

Q: Can I collect from you or visit you?
A:
Unfortunately not. Mum says I haven't tidied my bedroom properly. Sorry.

Q: Where is your jewellery made?
A:
Design is done in the UK. Production happens globally, always with trusted, audited partners using certified materials.

Q: Can I speak to someone?
A:
Other than the voices in your head? Lol, kidding.
Sure, you can email us at info@auricle.co.uk.
Hope everything’s okay.

A:
We don’t offer phone support, too many sales calls, sorry.

All of our customers, really.

Q: Are you part of Pierce of Art?
A:
No. We’re not the same company.

A:

A:
What is this, OnlyFans?

Depends what you’ve got in mind.

Q: Can I get free samples?
A:
Nope.
We don’t do freebies, just really good jewellery at proper prices.

Q: Do you offer discounts?
A:
Our prices are already too low to discount, we’ve priced things to be accessible for everyone.
That said, we occasionally run sales on end-of-line items to make space for the new stuff.

Q: Do you offer wholesale to jewellery stores?
A:
Yes, of course, that’s what we do.
Well… as long as you’re a proper store selling quality jewellery, not knock-offs next to phone cases.
That said, we still go through the same verification process as everyone else.

Q: Can I visit your premises?
A:
Nope — we’re not open to the public.
No walk-ins, no collections, no browsing. Everything’s online.

Q: Can I use your photos on my page?
A:
Yes, if you’re an approved stockist and actually selling the pieces shown.
Don’t remove watermarks or repost just to farm likes.
And you must abide by our usage terms, no exceptions.

Q: Can I stock your products in my shop?
A:
Yes, that’s the whole concept. Please do. Otherwise we’ll go broke.
Just register for an account and we’ll get you sorted.

Q: Do you do conventions?
A:
Maybe in the future we’ll show our face, but only at the good ones.

Q: Do you offer training or piercing tools?
A:
No. Just jewellery, and good jewellery at that.

A:
Nope, just jewellery, and good jewellery at that.

Q: Do you sell elsewhere or only here?
A:
Wholesale is only available here — this site is the source.
We don’t sell through distributors, marketplaces, or third-party platforms.
If it’s not on here, it’s not us. But you can buy through various retailers who stock AURICLE.

Q: Do you work with stockists?
A:
Depends what you mean by “stockist.”
We’re strictly B2B, we sell to retailers and studios only.
If you’re looking to resell, register for an account.
If you mean you’d like to distribute our jewellery, drop us an email, we’re open to the right setup.

Q: Do you have a discount code?
A:
Discount codes, if available, will be seen in your account.
